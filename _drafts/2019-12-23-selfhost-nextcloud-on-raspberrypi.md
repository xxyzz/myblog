Some of my relatives complain about their phone lack of storage every year. The main cause is that they take too much pictures. Assume one photo takes up five megabytes and in a frequency that ten photos each day, not count videos and totalitarian surveillance apps, that alone will be about 18 gigabytes per year. In reality, a 64GB phone won't make it more than two years. This time, I gonna solve it once for all.

My budget is tight and I don't want big brother holds any data of mine or my relatives. Therefor no kick ass server like Linus built or suspicious cloud services. All I need is a dusty raspberry pi, a black friday hard drive sale and [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software).
