I finished [*Butterfly and Dragonfly*](https://www.amazon.com/Butterfly-Dragonfly-Civil-1944-1950-Chinese/dp/7509772346){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} last month. It links World War II with the Civil War and the Cold war, you can get a grand but elaborate view of the history of these years. This book reminds me of [*Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom*](https://www.amazon.com/Autumn-Heavenly-Kingdom-China-Taiping-ebook/dp/B0050DIX42){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, both are outsiders' interventions deeply affect the fate of China. It has numerous references, so I don't intend on repeating these facts but merely focus on the currency in this post.

### Fa Bi
China starts using silver ingots since Han dynasty[^1]. In 1934, Roosevelt approved the Silver Purchase Act due to the Great Depression[^2]. Then worldwide silver price rose and there was an outflow of China's silver coins. So Chinese banks didn't have enough silver reserves to exchange the currency notes, the national economic climate was on the brink of collapse. The government had to abandon the silver standard in September 1935, China and Hong Kong are the last to abandon the silver standard.

On November 4, 1935, the Kuomintang government declared that the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications were authorized to issue [Fa Bi](https://www.wikiwand.com/zh-hans/%E6%B3%95%E5%B9%A3){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}(法币). The Bank of Agriculture was added later. Silver coins would be nationalized, one Fa Bi was equal to one silver coin. At first Fa Bi was exchangeable into British pound, then it was linked with U.S. dollar and British pound in 1936.

In 1938, Japanese issued its own notes and forced to exchange with Fa Bi in its controlled territories.
Then they went to foreign banks in Shanghai to convert the Fa Bi into hard currencies. The Nationalist government received over ten million pounds and fifty million dollars loans from Britain and the U.S. separately to support its currency for a while. After 1940, the government cancelLed unlimited forex trading. The currency war between the Nationalist government and the Japanese became a *real* war in 1941[^3]. A leading banker who was refused to server the Japanese currency was kidnapped by [Wang Jingwei](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Wang_Jingwei){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}'s agents. The KMT agents attracted the Central Reserve bank which was supported by the Japanese with guns and bombs a month later. The Nanjing government attracted post-KMT banks in response.

The Nationalist government printed Fa Bi endlessly as a result of Sino-Japanese War and lake of the American aids. The supply of Fa Bi from less than 1,400 million yuan in 1937 increased to 660,000 billion yuan in August 1948[^4]. [Chiang Kai-shek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}'s last hope was on currency reform to abandon Fa Bi.
