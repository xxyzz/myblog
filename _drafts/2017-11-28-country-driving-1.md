I have only read half of the book in a month and I have not write any post yetðŸ˜“, so this is the first post of [*Country Driving*](https://www.amazon.com/Country-Driving-Journey-Through-Factory-ebook/dp/B0035D9UX2){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Ho Wei rent a Cherokee 7250, "City Special", he drove along the Great Wall from Beijing. In [Yulin, Shaanxi](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yulin,+Shaanxi,+China/@38.2912914,109.5985687,11z){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, he was driven away by a man from the government. The secound time he made it to the [Subei, Gansu](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Subei,+Jiuquan,+Gansu,+China/@38.3636537,96.5280499,6z){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, two cops fined him one hundred yuan according their laws, so Chinese. In book II, Ho Wei rent a house in [Sancha](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sancha,+Huairou,+Beijing,+China/@40.6442359,116.5205377,1595m){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, this chapter is mainly about the landlord's uncle and his son.

I applied my driver's license after the college entrance examination, it took me a whole summer vacation. In order to get it done before the start of school, I chose a "VIP class", which can get the license more quickly and of course cost more money.
