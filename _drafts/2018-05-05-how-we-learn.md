[*How We Learn*](https://www.amazon.com/How-We-Learn-Surprising-Happens-ebook/dp/B00IWTTNZE){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} explains how we remember things and provides some useful tips for learning. Some are opposite to our common sense, for example, breaking good study habits. But the author list many studies to support his views.

### Breaking good habits
That means changing distinct places, time or listening to various music. Brains not only recode the contents you try to remember, but also the environment. More places will give brains more hints. I agree with that. Cuz I often fall asleep when setting in the classroom. Maybe study in the park is better. And listening music is truly a neat way to avoid dozing. After reading this book, I try to listen to Joe Hisaishi's albums when studying but that's not helpful.
