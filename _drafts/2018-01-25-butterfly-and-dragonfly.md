I finished [*Butterfly and Dragonfly*](https://www.amazon.com/Butterfly-Dragonfly-Civil-1944-1950-Chinese/dp/7509772346){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} last month, it's the first book I read about Kuomintang and the Communist Party. It links World War II with the Civil War and the Cold war, you can get a grand but elaborate view of the history of these years. This book reminds me of [*Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom*](https://www.amazon.com/Autumn-Heavenly-Kingdom-China-Taiping-ebook/dp/B0050DIX42){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, both are outsiders' interventions deeply affect the fate of China.
