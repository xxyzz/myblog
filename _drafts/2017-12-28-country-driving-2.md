In book III, Ho Wei went to some factory towns in southern China. He found a bra ring factory in [Lishui](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lishui,+Zhejiang,+China). Unlike the dying villages in northwest China, these south towns were full of energy and opportunities. People rushed in, factories sprout up. Even mountains can't slow down the change of landscape.

# Workers
At that time, young people were looking forward to working in big factories. They thought attending school was a burden and it's better to start factory career earlier. Since some jobs were paid by hours, workers preferred a job without vacation and offer overtime. Works wanted to make enough money to start their own business. But people are not machines, news about Foxconn's staff suicide almost appear every year[^1].

Works wrote self-help slogans on dormitory walls to inspire themselves. Self-help books are always popular in China. I remember a thin bestselling book called [*Who Moved My Cheese?*](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Who_Moved_My_Cheese%3F). The character in the book write slogans on the wall just like the workers, maybe workers did this because of the book. If you enter a bookstore in China, you probably will see lots of self-help books and health books. And if the bookstore is near a school, there will be full of textbooks and workbooks.

The relationship between works and bosses is quite interesting. When a boss poaches a worker, he will invite the worker to several luxury banquets first. The worker will change phone number, make some excuses to leave his former boss. A mysterious worker called Liu Hongwei, he changed at least four bosses by a blueprint which was drawn secretly from his memory. If the business is bad, the boss would not pay the salary for a few months to prevent the key workers fleeing the factory.

# Entrepreneurs
Most bosses and workers didn't have much education. But that won't stop them. The two bosses of the bra ring factory drawn the blueprint of their factory on a crumpled piece of paper in about one hour. And they pushed the gas canisters while smoking. Due to this lack of education and cheap labor resources, Chinese factories are hard to move beyond low-margin products.
