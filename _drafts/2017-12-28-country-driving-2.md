In book III, Ho Wei went to some factory towns in southern China. He found a bra ring factory in [Lishui](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lishui,+Zhejiang,+China). Unlike the dying villages in northwest China, these south towns were full of energy and opportunities. People rushed in, factories sprout up. Even mountains can't slow down the change of landscape.

# Workers
At that time, young people were looking forward to working in big factories. People wanted to make enough money to start their own business. Works wrote self-help slogans on dormitory walls to inspire themselves. Self-help books are always popular in China. I remember a thin bestselling book called [*Who Moved My Cheese?*](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Who_Moved_My_Cheese%3F). The two little people in the book write slogans on the wall just like the workers, maybe workers did this because of the book.
