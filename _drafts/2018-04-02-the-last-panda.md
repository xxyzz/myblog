In 1988, the WWF authorized [George Schaller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Schaller){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} to study the panda in China. He and his coworkers are the first batches of foreigners invited by the Chinese government to Wolong. Schaller found the biggest threat to the pandas actually was poaching instead of bamboo die-offs. It's hard to believe that even the best-loved animals have that pathetic period. Besides of these facts of pandas, you can also read about the tedious interaction between the NGOs, zoos, and governments.
