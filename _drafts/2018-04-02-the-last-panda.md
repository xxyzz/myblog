In 1988, the WWF authorized [George Schaller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Schaller){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} to study the panda in China. He and his coworkers are the first batches of foreigners invited by the Chinese government to Wolong. Schaller found the biggest threat to the pandas actually was poaching instead of bamboo die-offs. It's hard to believe that even the best-loved animals have that pathetic period. Besides of these facts of pandas, you can also read about the tedious interaction between the NGOs, zoos, and governments.

### Bamboo blossom

Most bamboos blossom at intervals of many years, then they die. Maybe that's bamboo's survival strategy, blossoming and fruiting at the same time will make sure some seeds will survival. The interesting thing is that even you move a bamboo to another continent, it will still blossom contemporary with its cohort. They spread widely through their rhizomes, that's why usually an entire mountain or a region's bamboos blossom simultaneously. If you plant bamboo in a garden, you need to keep pruning the roots or eating the shoots to control their spread. ðŸ˜‚
