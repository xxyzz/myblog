It's a homework not a formal thesis.

### Abstract

### Principle
If you look up from at the bottom of a pool at a certain angle, you will see the bottom as if the water-air interface is a mirror. That's a [total internal reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_internal_reflection) phenomenon, the same reason which keeps the light inside a fiber.

We can use [Snell's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law) to explain it: $$ n_1\sin \theta_i=n_2\sin \theta_t $$. N represents the [refractive index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index). Assuming that the left of the x-axis is [acrylic glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly(methyl_methacrylate)) and the right is air. Let $$ \theta_t= 90^\circ$$, $$ n_2 = $$ 1.00 and $$ n_1 = $$ 1.50, we get $$ \theta_c = 41.8^\circ $$. So when $$ n_2/n_1 \leq 1 $$ and light incidents on the border at larger than 41.8Â° would be totally internally reflected.

The middle part of the fiber is the core, it's surrounded by a transparent cladding material with a lower index of refraction.
