I finished [*Butterfly and Dragonfly*](https://www.amazon.com/Butterfly-Dragonfly-Civil-1944-1950-Chinese/dp/7509772346){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} two months ago ~~shame!~~. It links World War II with the Civil War and the Cold war, you can get a grand but elaborate view of the history of these years. This book reminds me of [*Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom*](https://www.amazon.com/Autumn-Heavenly-Kingdom-China-Taiping-ebook/dp/B0050DIX42){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, both are outsiders' interventions deeply affect the fate of China. I don't intend on repeating these facts in the book but merely focus on the currency in this post.

You can view the KMT's currencies and introduction at Central Bank of the Republic of China(Taiwan)'s [virtual money museum](https://museum.cbc.gov.tw/en/p6_1.aspx?menu=3&id=6){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

### Legal Tender Note
China starts using silver ingots since Han dynasty[^1]. In 1934, Roosevelt approved the Silver Purchase Act due to the Great Depression[^2]. Then worldwide silver price rose and there was an outflow of China's silver coins. So Chinese banks didn't have enough silver reserves to exchange the currency notes, the national economic climate was on the brink of collapse. The government had to abandon the silver standard in September 1935, China and Hong Kong are the last to abandon the silver standard.

On November 4, 1935, the Kuomintang government declared that the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications were authorized to issue [Legal Tender note](https://www.wikiwand.com/zh-hans/%E6%B3%95%E5%B9%A3){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}(法币). The Farmers Bank of China was added later. Silver coins would be nationalized, one Legal Tender yuan was equal to one silver coin. At first Legal Tender was exchangeable into British pound, then it was linked with U.S. dollar and British pound in 1936.

In 1938, Japanese issued its own notes and forced to exchange with Legal Tender in its controlled territories.
Then they went to foreign banks in Shanghai to convert the Legal Tender into hard currencies. The Nationalist government received over ten million pounds and fifty million dollars loans from Britain and the U.S. separately to support its currency for a while. After 1940, the government canceled unlimited forex trading, then the depreciation of Legal Tender started. The currency war between the Nationalist government and the Japanese became a *real* war in 1941[^3]. A leading banker who refused to serve the Japanese currency was kidnapped by [Wang Jingwei](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Wang_Jingwei){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}'s agents. The KMT agents attracted the Central Reserve bank which was supported by the Japanese with guns and bombs a month later. The Nanjing government attracted post-KMT banks in response.

The Nationalist government printed Legal Tender endlessly as a result of Sino-Japanese War and lack of the US economic aid. The supply of Legal Tender from less than 1,400 million yuan in 1937 increased to 660 trillion yuan in August 1948[^4]. [Chiang Kai-shek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} put his last hope on currency reform to replace Legal Tender with Gold Yuan notes.

### Gold Yuan Notes
On 8 August 1948, the Nationalist government issued [Gold Yun notes](https://www.wikiwand.com/zh-hans/%E9%87%91%E5%9C%93%E5%88%B8){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}(金圆券). The government planned to issued 2 billion yuan, one Gold Yun was equivalent to three million yuan in Legal Tender, that's about ten times of current notes. And they still printed notes endlessly like before. Furthermore, they also reduced the gold content of each yuan form 0.22217 gram to 0.044434 gram[^5]. So Gold Yuan soon became another Legal Tender. On 10 May 1949, Xinjiang Province Bank issued note each worth six billion yuan, it's the largest denomination banknote and the only which has two different currency units in Chinese history[^6]. It was originally stated that private gold, silver, and foreign exchange must be exchanged before September 30, but the Ministry of Finance extended the deadline for two months on 1 October, that's robbery! The KMT and the Gold Yuan lost people's trust, no doubt. The reform led to panic buying, foods sold out immediately in KMT's controlled big cities.

Meanwhile, the Communist Party gradually reversed the situation, they banned the Gold Yuan since June 1949[^5]. In May 1949, the KMT retreated to Guangzhou. They printed another waster paper: [Silver Dollar Notes](https://www.wikiwand.com/zh-hans/%E9%8A%80%E5%9C%93%E5%88%B8){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

### Bianbi
On 1 January 1941, Shaan-Gan-Ning border region government issued [Bianbi](https://www.wikiwand.com/zh-hans/%E8%BE%B9%E5%B8%81){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}(边币). The Shaan-Gan-Ning government banned Legal Tender and made Bianbi the only legal tender in the border region. At first, one Bianbi was equal to one Legal tender. But since the second half of 1943, the border region government also printed numerous waster paper. The civil war was destructive, but our clever comrades soon found a way: they sold *special goods*(特货)[^7]. *Special goods* are opium[^8][^9]. The opium trade was important to the CPC's finances in the 1940s when the KMT stopped funding [the Eighth Route Army](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Eighth_Route_Army){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}(What?!) and imposed an economic blockade on the border region. From September 1937 to October 1938, the KMT gave the Eighth Route Army 614,000 yuan each month[^10]. Wow! I didn't know that before. But wait, that happened after [Xi'an Incident](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Xi%27an_Incident){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}[^11].

![10 Yuan 1943 Bank of Shansi Chahar & Hopei. Local currency.](https://www.banknotes.com/CNS3160.JPG)

Ten Bianbi yuan, printed in 1943.

The People's Bank of China issued the [renminbi](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Renminbi){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} in December 1948. In December 1953, the largest denomination of [the first series of the renminbi](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/First_series_of_the_renminbi){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} had risen to 50,000 yuan[^12]. But don't worry, that's not a problem during the planned economy period.
