[*In Manchuria: A Village Called Wasteland and the Transformation of Rural China*](https://www.amazon.com/Manchuria-Village-Called-Wasteland-Transformation-ebook/dp/B00OZM4AP0/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=){:target="_blank"} is the second book by [Michael Meyer](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Michael_Meyer_(travel_writer)){:target="_blank"}. He lived in  [Dahuangdicun](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dahuangdicun,+Changyi,+Jilin,+China/@44.030945,126.3761573,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x5e47e49b75c13aab:0x8145aabc6261643c!8m2!3d44.030945!4d126.378346){:target="_blank"} for 3 years. He traveled in Dongbei to view the history, and saw the China's future in this vilage.

I never knew Shenyang has a [prisoner-of-war camp](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Erzhan+Mengjun+Zhanfu+Jizhongying+Former+Site/@41.809674,123.491435,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x302487938ce8e0e6!8m2!3d41.809674!4d123.491435){:target="_blank"} until I read the book. The exhibition hall is very small and poor. The barrack is really similar to our 	
dormitory. ðŸ’©
Our dormitory was built in 1952, the camp was 1943.ðŸ’©ðŸ’©

The Japanese plan for the city is still clearly visible. And many buildings are still in use.

Such as Zhongshan square in Shenyang, the Yamato Hotel is Liaoning Hotel now, the Fengtian Police Station is Shenyang Public Security Bureau, the Kwantung Army Headquarters is Shenyang General Labour Union.

In 1969, during the [Cultural Revolution](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cultural_Revolution){:target="_blank"}, the statue of Mao was built. Before that there was a [Russo-Japanese War](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Russo-Japanese_War){:target="_blank"} monument. After the Cultural Revolution, most of Mao's statue was removed, but this one is obviously an exception. We can see how crazy and ignorant of that age through it.

And [Neil Armstrong](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Neil_Armstrong#/Navy_service){:target="_blank"}'s plane was shot down in Korean War, a jeep driven by a roommate from flight school picked him up.
