## Mushroom

I learned something last year: if you eat lots of fresh copper spikes, your urine will turn <strong style="color:blue">red</strong> for the rest of the day. Don't panic! You're fine, that's just the part of the mushroom you can't digest.

## MOOC

The second week is a disaster, it's so horrible that it feels exactly like I was attending ... a college course. I was totally lost during the lectures and after solving some puzzles I may feel like I learned something but in fact I know nothing. There are at least three ways to save this course:

- explain why and how things work, don't read the definition

- more examples

- explain why each option of the quizzes is right or wrong and don't hide the options in the feedback page

## Scroll

I came across this Edo period scroll when I was searching something on Wikipedia, enjoy the art.

## Okay move along, move along people, there's nothing to see here!
