This is awesome! Thanks to [Github student pack](https://education.github.com/pack){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, this blog cost me $0! I am reading *Soft Skills: The Software Developer's Life Manual*, it's said you better get a blog. So I build one, and it's fun!

It's still need much work, but I'm so lazy and need to prepare the ~~fu**~~ final exams.

I have no idea what to write, but I will try my best to update it 2 or 3 times a week. I think post what I read is fine.

Maybe I should create a Chinese version blogü§î .

I found *The Gulag Archipelago* and *Selected Works of Hu Yaobang* in our school library, incredible.üëè
I thought I will never borrow a book(except teaching materials) from that poor library, it's all blame that e-book's typesetting a shit.
