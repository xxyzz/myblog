---

Samorost 2 and Samorost 3 were on sale at GOG last week, both are great adventure puzzle games. Samorost 2 runs on Adobe Flash and Samorost 3 installer is a `pkg` file, again both are headaches to install or run.

## Samorost 2

The Samorost 2 installer is a `dmg` file, easy to install but hard to run(blame Apple and Adobe). Click the game icon only opens a HTML file which embeds a `SWF` file. Installing Flash to your browser then open that file. If it doesn't work for a local file, try this:

```
$ cd /Applications/Samorost\ 2.app/Contents/Resources/game/Samorost2.app/Contents/Resources/html
$ python -m http.server 8001
```

Open `localhost:8001/Samorost2.html` and enjoy the game before Flash is dead.

Just checked today, the game is 32-bit and Flash will be EOL at the end of 2020. Damn, software surely isn't just a binary file. I was using Chrome to run this game when I wrote this post last year, now I strongly discourage you to install it if you care your data and privacy.

## Samorost 3

Some GOG `pkg` installers don't work at all. The `pkg` file contains a script called `postinstall`, it moves the game files to /Applications. For no reason, the `mv` command does nothing. You can use the following commands to extract `pkg`.

```
# extract pkg
xar -xf xxx.pkg

# extract Scripts
cd package.pkg
tar -xvf Scripts

# copy game files
cp -R payload /Applications/xxx.app
# or run ./postinstall

# clear files
cd ..
rm -rf package.pkg Distribution Resources xxx.pkg
```

This is better because I don't see the point of requiring admin privilege just to copy a folder. And most games powered by ScummVM include and run on an older version of ScummVM, I prefer to load them on the latest version anyway.
