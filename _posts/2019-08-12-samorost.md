[Samorost 2](https://www.gog.com/game/samorost2) and [Samorost 3](https://www.gog.com/game/samorost_3) were on sale at GOG last week, both are great adventure puzzle games. Samorost 2 runs on Adobe Flash and Samorost 3 installer is a `pkg` file, again both are headaches to install or run.

## Samorost 2

The Samorost 2 installer is a `dmg` file, easy to install but hard to run. Click the game icon only opens a  HTML file which embeds a `SWF` file. But Chrome 76 doesn't support Flash for local files. So I have to host this HTML file on `localhost` then try again:

```
$ cd /Applications/Samorost\ 2.app/Contents/Resources/game/Samorost2.app/Contents/Resources/html
$ python3 -m http.server 8001
```

Now open `chrome://settings/content/siteDetails?site=http://localhost:8001` on Chrome, allow Flash to run. Then open `localhost:8001/Samorost2.html` and enjoy the game before Flash dead.

## Samorost 3

Some GOG `pkg` installers don't work at all. The `pkg` file contains a script called `postinstall`, it moves the game files to a folder. For no reason, the `mv` command doesn't move the files inside the installer but works well when you run it manually. You can use the following script to extract `pkg` and run `postinstall` script.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Require .pkg file path."
    exit
fi

if [ ! -f $1 ]; then
    echo "File doesn't exist."
    exit
fi

# extract .pkg
xar -xf $1

# extract Scripts
cd package.pkg
tar -xvf Scripts

# copy game files
./postinstall

# clear files
cd ..
rm -rf package.pkg
rm -rf support
```
