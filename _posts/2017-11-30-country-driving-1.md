I have only read half of the book in a month and I have not write any post yet😶, so this is the first post of [*Country Driving*](https://www.amazon.com/Country-Driving-Journey-Through-Factory-ebook/dp/B0035D9UX2){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Ho Wei rent a Cherokee 7250, "City Special", he drove along the Great Wall from Beijing. In [Yulin, Shaanxi](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yulin,+Shaanxi,+China/@38.2912914,109.5985687,11z){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, he was driven away by a man from the government. The secound time he made it to the [Subei, Gansu](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Subei,+Jiuquan,+Gansu,+China/@38.3636537,96.5280499,6z){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, two cops fined him one hundred yuan according their laws, so Chinese. In book II, Ho Wei rent a house in [Sancha](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sancha,+Huairou,+Beijing,+China/@40.6442359,116.5205377,1595m){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, this chapter is mainly about the landlord's uncle Wei Ziqi and his son Wei Jia.

# My exprience of driver's test
I applied my driver's license after the college entrance examination, it took me a whole summer vacation. In order to get it done before the start of school, I chose a "VIP class", which can get the license more quickly and of course cost more money. 

The first test comprises 100 questions, there are 40 true or false questions and 60 multiple choice questions. You need to answer correctly at least 90 questions to pass. Before the test I practiced many times online, and most of time I failed. I just finished the college exam, how could I foucus on these shit? But in the examination room, the proctor told us that the test program will select the correct option automatically because we are the "VIP" and we better not get a 100 score😲. So I choosed two wrong answers. If I didn't cheat I would probably fail again. I think nobody can resist in that case.

The second test actually was the proctor pass it, I just sat there steped on the accelerator. Then I had to drive about 300(I forget the accurate figure) kilometers with a coach, there was a brake on his side and sometime he would control the steering wheel so I didn't worry about safety. The finall test I was on my own, I drove about 20 minutes on the proctor's instructions.

I have not drive a single once since then, I should learn to swim in that summer vacation.🤦 I always feel tired and sleepy when driving a real car, but I don't feel the same way when driving in video games. I heard that the test becomes harder every year, I'm the luck one who catch up the last esay test.

# Migrant
Ho Wei saw many dying villages on his way to the west. People were finding jobs in citis, leaving the elderly and children in the villages. He met many hitchers on the road, most were women who came home with gifts. He called this Chinese hitchhiking gesture "petting an invisible dog". In my hometown this gesture is not enough, sometimes you have to shout to get the texi driver's attention.😂

>in China, most migrants go home only once a year, during the Spring Festival, and this is especially true for those who find jobs far away. The people I met generally worked closer to home, in provincial cities or good-sized townships. For them, village trips were feasible, and women were more likely to make the effort, because they were attentive to parents and grandparents.

In [Ansicun](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ansicun,+Dingbian,+Yulin,+Shaanxi,+China/@37.506056,108.0741507,18.25z){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, only an old man and a flock of children lived here. This common scene maybe dispear in the future, Beijing is evicting so-called "low-end population" now[^1], welecome to xi's "new era" without "low-end population"! Beijing's temperature is sub-zero in the night. Many people are forced to leave their houses without any arrangement in this cold weather! I have watched videos about men in black hitting windows and pots to drive people away, buster! This movement will take 40 days because of a fire disaster, and the government's reaction was kick these people out. They also censor the word "low-end population"(in Chinese) from the Internet. Xi seems to feel more confident after the 19th party congress.

Thanks to ftchinese, they created four pictures show the movement's sphere of influence[^2]:

# RYB abuse scandal
Hard drives were damaged, parents are lying[^3], what a joke! This is what happening in 2017. Where is the CPC's bottom line, below the Mariana Trench?
