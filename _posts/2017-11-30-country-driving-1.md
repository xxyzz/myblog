I have only read half of the book in a month and I have not write any post yet😶, so this is the first post of [*Country Driving*](https://www.amazon.com/Country-Driving-Journey-Through-Factory-ebook/dp/B0035D9UX2){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Ho Wei rented a Cherokee 7250, "City Special", he drove along the Great Wall from Beijing. In [Yulin, Shaanxi](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yulin,+Shaanxi,+China/@38.2912914,109.5985687,11z){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, he was driven away by a man from the government. The second time he made it to the [Subei, Gansu](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Subei,+Jiuquan,+Gansu,+China/@38.3636537,96.5280499,6z){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, two cops fined him one hundred yuan according to their laws, so Chinese. In book II, Ho Wei rented a house in [Sancha](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sancha,+Huairou,+Beijing,+China/@40.6442359,116.5205377,1595m){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, this chapter is mainly about the landlord's uncle Wei Ziqi and his son Wei Jia.

### My experience of driver's test
I applied for my driver's license after the college entrance examination, it took me a whole summer vacation. In order to get it done before the start of school, I chose a "VIP class", which can get the license more quickly and of course cost more money. 

The first test comprises 100 questions, there are 40 true or false questions and 60 multiple choice questions. You need to answer correctly at least 90 questions to pass. Before the test, I practiced many times online, and most of the time I failed. I just finished the college exam, how could I focus on these shit? But in the examination room, the proctor told us that the test program will select the correct option automatically because we are the "VIP" and we better not get a 100 score😲. So I chose two wrong answers. If I didn't cheat I would probably fail again. I think nobody can resist in that case.

The second test actually was the proctor pass it, I just sat there stepped on the accelerator. Then I had to drive about 300(I forget the accurate figure) kilometers with a coach, there was a brake on his side and sometime he would control the steering wheel so I didn't worry about safety. The final test I was on my own, I drove about 20 minutes on the proctor's instructions.

I have not driven a single once since then, I should learn to swim in that summer vacation.🤦 I always feel tired and sleepy when driving a real car, but I don't feel the same way when driving in video games. I heard that the test becomes harder every year, I'm the lucky one who catches up the last easy test.

### The Wall
I have been to three walls: [Badaling](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Badaling){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, [Hushan Great Wall](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hushan_Great_Wall){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, [Shanhaiguan](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Shanhai_Pass){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Hushan Great Wall is the most easterly known part of the Great Wall. On the Hushan Wall, you will see North Korea's farmland. You can also take a boat to cross the border in the middle of Yalu River. But the scenic area is too shabby and small, the ticket doesn't worth 80 yuan. Shanhaiguan is one of the heavily fortified passes in China. Even during the Second Sino-Japanese War and Chinese Civil War, it was still an important pass. The east part of the wall "Laolongtou" meets the Bohai Sea. As for Badaling, all I saw were people.🙃

### Migrant
Ho Wei saw many dying villages on his way to the west. People were finding jobs in cities, leaving the elderly and children in the villages. He met many hitchers on the road, most were women who came home with gifts. He called this Chinese hitchhiking gesture "petting an invisible dog". In my hometown this gesture is not enough, sometimes you have to shout to get the taxi driver's attention.😂

>in China, most migrants go home only once a year, during the Spring Festival, and this is especially true for those who find jobs far away. The people I met generally worked closer to home, in provincial cities or good-sized townships. For them, village trips were feasible, and women were more likely to make the effort, because they were attentive to parents and grandparents.

In [Ansicun](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ansicun,+Dingbian,+Yulin,+Shaanxi,+China/@37.506056,108.0741507,18.25z){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, only an old man and a flock of children lived here. This common scene maybe disappears in the future, Beijing is evicting so-called *low-end population* now[^1]. Beijing's temperature is sub-zero in the night these days. Many people are forced to leave their houses without any arrangement in this cold weather! I have watched videos of men in black hitting windows and pots to drive people away, busters! This movement will take forty days because of a fire disaster, and the government's reaction was kicking these people out. They also censor the word "low-end population" from Wechat and Weibo. Welcome to the [*new era*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping_Thought){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} without low-end population.

Ftchinese created four pictures of the movement's sphere of influence[^2].

### The Party
Wei Ziqi joined the party for his business. He needs the local party members' support to get a bank loan. After Xi came to power in 2012, the increase of party members rate decreases every year[^3]. The party wants more loyalty, of course, they won't let "parasites" join. Party members even have meetings in public security bureau to get "educated" now.

>Last year the total volume of applications to join the party fell by about 10%—the first big drop in years—perhaps because stricter enforcement of party regulations and renewed efforts to collect membership dues is making party life look less appealing.
