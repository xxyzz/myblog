Early this month I was reading Cliff Stoll's *The Cuckoo's egg*, it's about how he hunt a Soviet hacker in the 1980s. During his investigation, by then the NCSC chief scientist Bob Morris asked a question for him: what's the next number of the sequence 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221?

I happened to find that a nine digits .xyz domain only cost $0.98 a year by viewing Wikipedia last week, that's a reasonable price of an untouchable thing and fun. So here we are, the new domain 111211211.xyz will points to this blog at least one year until I feel bored.

Cliff surely is an interesting and passionate guy, watch a few Numberphile videos of him you will agree with me. As of the book, definitely worth the time. You will know how to trace the route to locate a criminal; how a UNIX guru can tell the hacker is not from California by a single command; what Internet was like in the early days and how come a network depends on trust can lead to havoc. You can also sense NSA already collecting data from that time, Snowden's *Permanent Record* has more details.

Everyone should wash their hands more frequently now so don't forget to bring a towel.
