description: "Boycott, Romanization of Chinese(Latinxua Sin Wenz). Hope this book can be published in 'Chat nar' someday."
---

[*Oracle Bones*](https://www.amazon.com/Oracle-Bones-Journey-Through-China/dp/0060826592) is [Peter Hessler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hessler)'s second book. He and [Michael Meyer]({% post_url 2017-07-07-in-manchuria %}) were in the same [Peace Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Corps). This book narrates around three parallel stories: his former students, a Uighur dissident, and the research of [Chen Mengjia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Mengjia). No doubt, this book is verified  by the party.

### Boycott

Hatred of western countries and Japan seems like a "default setting" of Chinese people. But when you ask them the main reason for their hatred, they just become vague. Someone might mention the history of aggression, then why don't they hate Russia, Mongols or Manchu?

>Like Gao, many Chinese citizens, sorting through often conflicting information from state-run media, the Internet, and word of mouth, are responding to the incident with as many questions as opinions.
>
While initial comments tend to be angry and unequivocal—especially when addressed to members of the foreign press corps—longer discussions reveal frustration and powerlessness….

Angry parade, boycott some companies, an officer call for restraint, then forgotten. A common pattern repeats every few years, it reminds me of "two minutes hate" in *1984*. And the reasons of recent years' conflicts are more retarded.

There is a story about the etymology of word [boycott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott): during the Irish "Land War", 1880. [Charles Boycott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Boycott) was the land agent of landlord Lord Erne.

>He(Lord Erne) had agreed to a 10 per cent reduction owing to a poor harvest, but all except two of his tenants demanded a 25 per cent reduction ... He(Charles Boycott) then issued demands for the outstanding rents, and obtained eviction notices against eleven tenants.

-- <cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Boycott#Community_action)</cite>

On 19 September 1880, [Parnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stewart_Parnell) gave a speech in Ennis. He proposed that people should shun the tenants who take farms where another tenant was evicted. Three days later, a tenant refused to accept the notice, and the local women succeeded in driving the process server away. Then all Boycott's employees left, and he was isolated, no one serviced him. His name appeared in many newspapers, then the word "boycott" was used to describe his situation.

### Romanization of Chinese

During the 1920-1930s, the Soviet Union launched [Latinisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinisation_in_the_Soviet_Union) campaign. It's aimed to replace traditional writing systems for numerous languages with Latin script. They thought Latin alphabet can simplify languages in order to eradicate illiteracy. [On January 25, 1930](http://www.fift.ugal.ro/revistadeistorie/anale/10/1007%20SISCANU.pdf), Stalin signed the decision "regarding the Latinisation", Latinisation was stopped. In 1938, all newly Latinised languages were converted to Cyrillic.

[Latinxua Sin Wenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinxua_Sin_Wenz) is one of the languages created in Latinisation. Unlike other romanization schemes, Latinxua Sin Wenz system's purpose was to supersede the Chinese characters from the very outset. And it's the first romanization system to replace the Chinese characters by native Chinese speakers. In 1931, the Latinxua Sin Wenz system was established. It was supported by a number of Chinese intellectuals such as Guo Moruo and Lu Xun. Chinese has four tones(and a neutral tone), but Latinxua does not indicate tones at all. Its creators wanted to  abandon tones, they thought tones limit the development of Chinese, Chinese will be simpler and more reasonable without tones. You can view a Sin Wenz guidebook at [here](http://www.pinyin.info/romanization/sinwenz/index.html).

Maybe communists wanted to get more support, they withdrew support for Latinxua Sin Wenz in 1944. Before that, there are more than 300 Latinxua Sin Wenz publications.

According to *Hu Qiaomu Huiyi Mao Zedong*, when Mao visited the Soviet, Stalin told Mao: "You’re a great country, and you should have your own Chinese alphabet (zimu). You shouldn’t simply use the Latin alphabet". Maybe this is why Mao proposed simplified Chinese, [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin) and abandon Latinization.

In 1955, Premier Zhou Enlai assigned [Zhou Youguang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Youguang) the task of developing a new romanization system. Zhou Youguang is often called "the father of Pinyin". But he called himself "the son of pinyin". The first edition of *Hanyu Pinyin* was approved and adopted on February 11, 1958.
