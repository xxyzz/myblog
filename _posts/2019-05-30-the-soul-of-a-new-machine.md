The domain xxyzz.me will expire on June 25, 2019, after that you can access this blog with [xxyzz-f0041.web.app](https://xxyzz-f0041.web.app) or [xxyzz-f0041.firebaseapp.com](https://xxyzz-f0041.firebaseapp.com). That also means my blog runs almost two years, wow!

I get to know *The Soul of a New Machine* from the references of [OSTEP](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/). The professor said it's a must-read so I better have a look. You can read the plot of this book on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine).

Data General engineers work perhaps more than twelve hours a day without extra pay, sounds like [996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/996_working_hour_system)? No! The difference is no one forces them. They thought they were building "their machine" instead of a "Data General machine". This challenging but interesting job with the freedom to invent made them "don't work for money" and push them to work harder.

Forcing people working overtime on trivial, boring and meaningless jobs is clearly not efficient, as for no extra pay, that breaks the law. If nowadays working condition is even worse than 1980...
